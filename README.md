#Shipping Delay Analysis

##Project Overview
In this project, I take on the role of a data analyst tasked with investigating shipping delay issues using the Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist. My objective is to conduct an in-depth analysis to identify the root causes of shipping delays, their impact on customer satisfaction, and provide actionable insights to help Olist’s stakeholders optimize their logistics and improve overall customer experience.

##Demonstrated Skills
Data Manipulation and Analysis: Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy to extract, transform, and analyze data from the Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist.
Data Visualization: Created informative and engaging visualizations using Matplotlib to effectively communicate insights and patterns in the data.
Problem-Solving: Applied analytical skills to identify the root causes of shipping delays and their impact on customer satisfaction.
Insight Generation: Formulated actionable recommendations to support informed decision-making and optimize logistics for Olist’s stakeholders.

##Tools Used
Google Colab: Cloud-based platform used for data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.
Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization, respectively.
GitHub: Project code and reports uploaded to GitHub for version control and portfolio showcase.

##Data Exploration
The Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist is a complex network of interconnected tables, which can be visualized through a comprehensive graph. This graph illustrates the relationships between various entities such as customers, orders, products, sellers, and reviews, providing a clear understanding of the dataset’s structure.
